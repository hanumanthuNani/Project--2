# Project--2
Here’s a description you can use for your LinkedIn post to announce the FLAMES game website:

🚀 **Just Launched: My New FLAMES Game Website! 🔥**  
I'm excited to share a fun side project I’ve been working on—an interactive **FLAMES game website**! 🎉

🖥️ This project is all about bringing back the classic FLAMES game we used to play, but with a modern twist. It takes two names, calculates your FLAMES result, and gives you a fun answer with playful emojis and animations! 💥

🎨 **Tech Highlights**:
- Designed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Fun animations powered by **Animate.css**.
- Clean and modern UI for a smooth user experience.
- Features a "Buy me coffee" button for support and a link to my **GitHub**.

Would love your feedback and thoughts on this! 😊
